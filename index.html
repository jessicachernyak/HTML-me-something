            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>If you had told me 5 years ago that I would be able to squat my 20-something year old sister, 
                I would've said &quot;Yeah, maybe in another universe!&quot; Never in my lifetime would 
                I have thought that I would be going to the gym regularly – and love it. I was the skinny 
                girl that could barely lift 10 lb dumbbells to save my life. Plus why would I need to anyway? 
                I had my parents&apos; good genes to thank for my metabolism. I didn't even work out once when 
                I was getting married. No, my fitness journey didn't start until after tying the knot. So what 
                got me into fitness and how did I get here? Well... I&apos;ve learned a lot since growing into 
                this new hobby over the next few years, and this is my story.</p>

            <h3>August 2015</h3>
            <p>When I started going to the gym, I wasn't on a health kick, there wasn't an urge to change 
                something about myself, nor did I have any incentives to go. It all began when my co&#8209;worker 
                Melissa suggested a few of us to join the new gym down the street. She had been working out regularly 
                for years and participated in weight-lifting competitions. I wasn't sure how often I'd go, so 
                after the free week trial I decided to just get the month-to-month plan. I knew nothing about 
                lifting weights, but Melissa I learned a lot from Melissa about proper form, various exercises, 
                and many other tips. Mondays ended up being squat day, Wednesdays being benchpress, and Fridays 
                deadlift.</p>

            <h3>Mini Goals</h3>
            <p>After a few weeks I was able to lift 5 lbs more, and that made me feel a sense of accomplishment, 
                which made me want to keep going. Seeing results encouraged me to move up 5 lbs more, and again 
                the next month. I got excited when I hit what I considered milestones, like 100 lbs. And each 
                time I went up 10 lbs I treated myself to a new sportsbra, shirt, or other workout item. Pretty 
                soon I had created my own goals and incentives. Having small, obtainable goals helped me stay on 
                track.</p>

            <h3>Change</h3>
            <p>Then, I finally started seeing other results. My physique changed, I felt better physically as 
                well as mentally, and I found myself eating even healthier than before. My husband noticed an 
                improvement in my posture and confidence. I was in a happier place. All of these combined 
                motivated me to keep up with the routine and grow into my new lifestyle. It hasn't always been 
                easy, but I'm proud to say that it's been over 3 years I am still at it. Now 
                fitness and health is a true passion of mine – I love talking about it, learning about it, and 
                living it. This year my husband and I started running in marathons, which quickly became a new 
                activity we enjoy together. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me on this never-ending 
                journey.</p>
